# Features
It gives team members the ability to look at their assigned tasks, sign up for and schedule meetings with other teammates, and view what tasks have been done and still need to be done. Each major action taken, such as scheduling a meeting or assigning a task, will come with an email to the relevant employeesâ€™ supplied email addresses. All users will also be able to link their personal calendars to make meetings even easier to work into their busy schedules. Marathon will make it easier and less complex to create enterprise-level code with smaller teams that communicate more effectively.
